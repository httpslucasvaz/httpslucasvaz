I'm front-end developer currently focused on <strong>ReactJs, TypeScript, and NextJs</strong>. I'm currently transitioning careers and pursuing a degree in analysis and systems development. Seeking my first opportunity in the development field, I bring with me 29 years of age and professional experiences that have shaped me into a responsible and positive professional with excellent teamwork skills. Passionate about technology, I am constantly striving to improve myself and stay updated to become a better and up-to-date professional every day.
